# Contributing to the Strategist Platform

Welcome, and thank you for your interest.

## Contributor’s Current Focus

### Development of a Basic Generic Agentic RAG

Your current focus as a contributor is to develop a **basic, generic Agentic RAG** — that is, a simple and adaptable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system (tentatively using **LlamaIndex**) that can be queried by a coordinated team of agents (tentatively using **CrewAI agents**).  

“Generic” here means that both the RAG system and the agentic workflow can be easily customized for any desired use case, including your personal projects.

### The Strategist-MVP

To develop a **generic Agentic RAG**, it is practical to begin with data from a specific use case. Once developed, the Agentic RAG can then be **generalized or adapted** for other applications.

In our case, we will develop the Agentic RAG for the following use case: **designing the corporate strategy for a company of interest**. We will refer to this initial Agentic RAG as the **Strategist-MVP**.

 This will primarily involve:

- Using public documents from the target company and its industry to build the **RAG knowledge base**.
- Designing **agentic workflows**, aligned with the **corporate strategy** logic outlined in the Corporate Strategy repository, to query the **RAG** effectively.

## Getting Started

Please follow the guidance provided in the [Strategist-MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/14) when developing or contributing to the **Strategist-MVP** described above. The project includes example scripts and repositories that you may use as a rough foundation. However, at this stage, we encourage you to build your own version from scratch—exploring alternative approaches and potential improvements—and use the **Strategit-MVP project** materials only as a reference.

## Help and Office Hours

### There is too much help out there

Make yourself self-sufficient by using the many resources available, including the following:

- **LLMs** (Claude (recommended), ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Mistral, Qwen, etc.) are a great resource for coding. Just tell them specifically what you need in a prompt and start a chat, guiding them along until you get all the code and explanations/guidance you need.

- **Relevant YouTube videos** are also very helpful.

- **Library/framework documentation** is very helpful (and it's usually better than third-party documentation, websites, blogs, etc. about the same libraries/frameworks).

- **Our [tutorials](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github/tree/main/tutorials) and [projects](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects)**.

- **The community**, including your peer contributors' issues and comments in our [tutorials](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github/tree/main/tutorials) and [projects](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects). You may suggest improvements to any issue by using its comment function.

**Office Hours:**
Contributors should primarily rely on the resources listed above and expect minimal direct assistance from the owners, administrators, and maintainers of Strategist’s open-source repositories. Twice a week, we hold office hours. Contributors—especially interns—are encouraged to join whenever they need support by using the following links:

- [Fridays at 8:30PM IST (India) / 10:30AM EST (US/Canada)](https://calendar.app.google/ZkVZHve7jgR8zoZb6)
