# Help

## There is too much help out there.

Make yourself self-sufficient by using the many resources available, including the following:

- **LLMs** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity, etc.) are a great resource for coding. Just tell them specifically what you need in a prompt and start a chat, guiding them along until you get all the code and explanations/guidance you need.

- **Relevant YouTube videos** are also very helpful.

- **Library/framework documentation** is very helpful (and it's usually better than third-party documentation, websites, blogs, etc. about the same libraries/frameworks).

- **The community**, including your peer contributors' issues and comments.

Therefore, expect minimal or no help from owners, admins, and maintainers of Strategist's open source repos. Instead, focus on getting help from the above resources.
