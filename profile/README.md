## Contributors:

Our generative AI (GenAI) model is versatile by design, enabling application across a wide range of use cases—not just corporate strategy design. The core architecture is a generic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built with LlamaIndex, which is queried by a coordinated team of CrewAI agents. Both the RAG system and the agentic workflow can be customized for specific use cases.

As a contributor to this OSS platform, your focus should not be on corporate strategy. Instead, your primary goal is to develop the underlying GenAI technologies that power the platform.
