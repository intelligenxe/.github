### Contributors’ Current Focus

At this stage of the platform's development, contributors should focus on developing a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for either model

**Strategist-modular** (see [repository](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular/tree/main), [diagram](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular/blob/main/docs/GUIDE_2.md#full-integration-flow) and [MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/8))
- Knowledge Base (LlamaIndex) 
- CrewAI Agents  
- Workflow Orchestrator  

or

**Strategist-small** (see [repository](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small/tree/main), [diagram](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small/tree/main/docs#-workflow) and [MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/7)) 

The repositories above are preliminary examples. We encourage contributors to develop their own versions from scratch, exploring alternative approaches as needed.

### Getting Started: Workflow and Deliverables

As a contributor, select one of the 2 repos/models above and complete the following steps:

1. **Clone** the source code or start from scratch to develop an equivalent module.  
2. **Debug / Develop** your code.  
3. **Run** it on your local machine.  
4. **Deploy** it on a free hosting platform (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, etc.) or build a Django app to deploy it on our servers.  
5. **Request** a demo meeting and/or submit your model’s URL and evaluation test results.  
6. **Submit** a Pull Request.  

Depending on your model choice, for more details use the [Strategist-modular-MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/8) or [Strategist-small-MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/7).
