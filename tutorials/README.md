## There is too much help out there.

Make yourself self-sufficient by using the many resources available, including the following:

- **LLMs** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Perplexity, etc.) are a great resource for coding. Just tell them specifically what you need in a prompt and start a chat, guiding them along until you get all the code and explanations/guidance you need.

- **Relevant YouTube videos** are also very helpful.

- **Library/framework documentation** is very helpful (and it's usually better than third-party documentation, websites, blogs, etc. about the same libraries/frameworks).

- **The community**, including your peer contributors' issues and comments.
