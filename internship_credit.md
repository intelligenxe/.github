## Internship Credit for Student and Recent Graduate Contributors

**INTELLIGENXE** offers internship credit opportunities to qualified contributors participating in the **Strategist** open-source platform. These credits recognize meaningful technical contributions and allow students and recent graduates to gain hands-on experience in Generative AI (GenAI) development. Internship credit from INTELLIGENXE Inc. may be added to your résumé and LinkedIn profile upon completing predetermined sets of contributions.

All work completed under this program is voluntary and intended as a training exercise to build practical skills and advance your professional career. Contributors should not expect monetary compensation and perform the internship at their own risk. The internship programs are designed to require no supervision, so ongoing support from maintainers should not be expected. Additionally, contributors must agree to the terms and conditions outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Internship credit is available worldwide to student and early-career contributors who make significant contributions. In the United States, Canada, and the European Union, internship credit is offered primarily through academic partnerships between local universities and INTELLIGENXE Inc.
