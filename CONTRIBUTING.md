## Contributor’s Current Focus

### Development of a Basic Generic Agentic RAG

Your current focus as a contributor is to develop a **basic, generic Agentic RAG** — that is, a simple and adaptable **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system (tentatively using **LlamaIndex**) that can be queried by a coordinated team of agents (tentatively using **CrewAI agents**).  

“Generic” here means that both the RAG system and the agentic workflow can be easily customized for any desired use case. In this way, you will be developing an **open-source (OSS) tool** that you can later reuse for multiple personal projects and applications.



### The Strategist MVP

Subsequently (or concurrently), you will be able to develop the **Strategist’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** by customizing the generic Agentic RAG described above. This will primarily involve:

- Using public documents from the client company and its industry as the **RAG knowledge base**
- Designing the **agentic workflow prompts** according to the corporate strategy logic provided in the **Corporate Strategy** repository

---

## Getting Started

To develop either **the basic Agentic RAG** or **the Strategist MVP**, select one of the following two models/repositories and use the workflow in its corresponding MVP project as a guide:

-- **Strategist-modular** (see [repository](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular/tree/main), [diagram](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular/blob/main/docs/GUIDE_2.md#full-integration-flow) and [MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/8))
- Knowledge Base (LlamaIndex) 
- CrewAI Agents  
- Workflow Orchestrator  

-- **Strategist-small** (see [repository](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small/tree/main), [diagram](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small/tree/main/docs#-workflow) and [MVP project](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/7)) 

These repositories serve as preliminary examples. We encourage you to **develop your own version from scratch**, exploring alternative approaches and improvements as needed.

### Workflow and Deliverables

1. **Clone** the source code or start from scratch to develop an equivalent module.  
2. **Debug / Develop** your code.  
3. **Run** it on your local machine.  
4. **Deploy** it on a free hosting platform (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, etc.) or build a Django app to deploy it on our servers.  
5. **Request** a demo meeting and/or submit your model’s URL and evaluation test results.  
6. **Submit** a Pull Request.

## Help

### There is too much help out there

Make yourself self-sufficient by using the many resources available, including the following:

- **LLMs** (Claude (recommended), ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, Mistral, Qwen, etc.) are a great resource for coding. Just tell them specifically what you need in a prompt and start a chat, guiding them along until you get all the code and explanations/guidance you need.

- **Relevant YouTube videos** are also very helpful.

- **Library/framework documentation** is very helpful (and it's usually better than third-party documentation, websites, blogs, etc. about the same libraries/frameworks).

- **The community**, including your peer contributors' issues and comments in our [tutorials](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github/tree/main/tutorials) and [projects](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects).

Therefore, expect minimal or no help from owners, admins, and maintainers of Strategist's open source repos. Instead, focus on getting help from the above resources.

## No Guarantee of Review or Maintenance

INTELLIGENXE gives **no guarantee of timely or proper maintenance** whatsoever for the platform's repositories. Furthermore, there is **no guarantee that contributors will receive timely or proper feedback** on their submissions, or that their contributions will be implemented in the platform. This can be due to various reasons, including limited resources and/or a lack of value, clarity, or feasibility in the submission. However, INTELLIGENXE does make an effort to **promote top contributors to maintainer roles** and automate processes to reduce these risks and improve the overall contributor experience.
