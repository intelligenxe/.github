# INTELLIGENXE

## The Platform: Strategist

**Strategist** is INTELLIGENXE’s open-source software (OSS) platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to generate AI-driven corporate strategies for organizations, business units, and projects. The platform spans multiple repositories within the INTELLIGENXE GitHub organization, including the following:

- [.github](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github)
- [Strategist-small](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small)
- [Strategist-modular](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular)
- [AI-driven-strategy](https://github.com/intelligenxe/AI-driven-strategy)


## Contributors:

As a contributor to this open-source (OSS) platform, you do not need to focus on designing corporate strategies. Your primary goal is to develop the generative AI (GenAI) technologies that power the platform — flexible, reusable tools that can be applied to a wide range of use cases beyond strategic planning, including your own personal projects.
