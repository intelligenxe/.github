### Contributors’ Current Focus

At the current stage of the platform, as a contributor you should focus on developing a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for either:

[Strategist-modular](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular/tree/main) ([see diagram](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-modular/blob/main/docs/GUIDE_2.md#full-integration-flow))
- Knowledge Base (LlamaIndex) 
- CrewAI Agents  
- Workflow Orchestrator  

Or

[Strategist-small](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small/tree/main) ([see diagram](https://github.com/intelligenxe/Strategist-small/tree/main/docs#-workflow)) 

The above repos are just rough examples, you should feel free to develop your own version from scratch and by using a different approach.

### Getting Started: Workflow and Deliverables

As a contributor, select one of the above 2 repos and complete the following steps:

1. **Clone** the source code or start from scratch to develop an equivalent module.  
2. **Debug / Develop** your code.  
3. **Run** it on your local machine.  
4. **Deploy** it on a free hosting platform (e.g., Streamlit, Gradio, etc.) or build a Django app to deploy it on our servers.  
5. **Request** a demo meeting and/or submit your model’s URL and evaluation test results.  
6. **Submit** a Pull Request.  

For more details, please use the [Strategist MVP](https://github.com/orgs/intelligenxe/projects/4) project.
