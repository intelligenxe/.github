## Internship Credit for Student and Recent Graduate Contributors

**INTELLIGENXE** offers **internship credit** opportunities to qualified contributors participating in the **Strategist** open-source platform. These credits recognize meaningful technical contributions and allow students and recent graduates ("contributors")to gain hands-on experience in Generative AI (GenAI) development. Internship credit from INTELLIGENXE Inc. may be added to your résumé and LinkedIn profile **upon completing predetermined sets of contributions**.

All work completed under this program is voluntary and intended as a training exercise to build practical skills and advance your professional career. **Contributors should not expect monetary compensation and perform the internship at their own risk**, including the possibility of not reaching required milestones and therefore not receiving credit. Contributors must agree to the terms and conditions outlined in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), including requiring minimal supervision ([see Help and Office Hours section](https://github.com/intelligenxe/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#help)) as the internship is designed to be self-directed.

Internship credit is **available worldwide** to student and early-career contributors who make significant contributions. In the United States, Canada, and the European Union, internship credit is offered primarily through academic partnerships between local universities and INTELLIGENXE Inc.
